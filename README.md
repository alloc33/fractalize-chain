# FractalizeChain

**Fair Value Extraction infrastructure for Polkadot ecosystem**

A Substrate-based blockchain that democratizes MEV by making value extraction accessible, transparent, and fairly distributed across the network.

---

## The Problem

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) extraction is currently centralized:
- 90%+ of MEV profits go to sophisticated players with expensive infrastructure
- Individual users have no access to arbitrage opportunities
- Cross-chain arbitrage requires significant capital and technical expertise
- Value extraction happens in the dark, benefiting only the few

**$500M+ in MEV is extracted daily. The system is broken.**

## Our Solution

FractalizeChain provides open infrastructure for fair value extraction:

‚úÖ **Accessible** - Anyone can participate as validator or user
‚úÖ **Transparent** - All opportunities and distributions on-chain
‚úÖ **Fair** - Profits distributed across network participants
‚úÖ **Cross-chain** - Detects opportunities across multiple chains
‚úÖ **Capital-efficient** - Flash loan integration removes capital requirements

### How It Works

```
Offchain Workers ‚Üí Monitor DEXs across chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche)
                 ‚Üì
              Detect arbitrage opportunities
                 ‚Üì
         Submit unsigned transactions to chain
                 ‚Üì
    Validators validate and include in blocks
                 ‚Üì
        Execute arbitrage via flash loans
                 ‚Üì
   Distribute profits fairly: Validators (45%) + Users (35%) + Protocol (15%) + Treasury (5%)
```

**Direct smart contract calls** - No API dependencies, real-time price discovery via contract state queries.

## Current Status

üöß **Early Development** - Foundation being built

**Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Price Oracle Pallet** - Production-ready offchain workers with unsigned transactions
- ‚úÖ **Multi-chain support** - Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche
- ‚úÖ **5 DEX integrations** - Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, QuickSwap, Trader Joe
- ‚úÖ **Real-time price feeds** - Direct `slot0()` and `getReserves()` calls
- ‚úÖ **27 passing tests** - Production-quality code

**In Development:**
- ‚è≥ Flash loan pallet (capital-free arbitrage)
- ‚è≥ Opportunity detection engine
- ‚è≥ Fair distribution mechanism
- ‚è≥ Cross-chain bridge integration

## Architecture

### Price Oracle Pallet

Offchain workers fetch prices directly from DEX contracts every N blocks:

```rust
// Offchain worker runs at configured interval
fn offchain_worker(block_number: BlockNumberFor<T>) {
    for pair in supported_pairs {
        let exchanges = registry::get_all_exchanges();
        for exchange in exchanges {
            // Direct contract call (no API)
            let (price, timestamp) = exchange.fetch_price(pair)?;

            // Submit via unsigned transaction
            let call = Call::submit_price_unsigned { pair, exchange_id, price, timestamp };
            T::create_bare(call.into());
            SubmitTransaction::submit_transaction(xt)?;
        }
    }
}
```

**Unsigned transactions** bridge offchain data collection with onchain storage, validated by `ValidateUnsigned` trait.

### Supported DEXs

| Exchange | Chain | Protocol |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Uniswap V3 | Ethereum | V3 (concentrated liquidity) |
| SushiSwap | Ethereum | V2 (constant product) |
| PancakeSwap | BSC | V2 |
| QuickSwap | Polygon | V2 |
| Trader Joe | Avalanche | V2 |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the chain
cargo build --release

# Run local development node
./target/release/fractalize-chain-node --dev

# Watch price oracle activity
RUST_LOG=runtime=debug,pallet_price_oracle=debug \
  ./target/release/fractalize-chain-node --dev
```

## Development Roadmap

**Phase 1: Price Infrastructure** ‚úÖ (Current)
- Multi-chain price oracle with offchain workers
- Direct DEX contract integration
- Unsigned transaction validation

**Phase 2: Opportunity Detection** üöß (Next 4-8 weeks)
- Cross-chain arbitrage detection logic
- Profit calculation with gas cost estimation
- Minimum viable opportunity thresholds

**Phase 3: Flash Loan Integration** (8-16 weeks)
- Native flash loan pallet
- Integration with price oracle
- Atomic arbitrage execution

**Phase 4: Fair Distribution** (16-24 weeks)
- Validator reward mechanism
- User profit distribution
- Protocol fee collection
- Treasury governance

**Phase 5: Testnet Launch** (24+ weeks)
- Public testnet deployment
- Validator recruitment
- Community building
- Economic model testing

## Why Substrate?

- **Offchain workers** - Perfect for fetching external DEX data
- **Unsigned transactions** - Offchain ‚Üí onchain data flow without accounts
- **Modular pallets** - Clean separation of concerns (oracle, flash loans, arbitrage)
- **Production-ready** - Battle-tested framework from Parity
- **Polkadot ecosystem** - Aligns with JAM vision and Web3 infrastructure

## Project Philosophy

**Open Source Infrastructure**
- All core pallets are open source
- Community can audit, contribute, and fork
- Transparent by default

**Fair by Design**
- Profit distribution hardcoded in protocol
- No extraction by core team beyond protocol fee
- Validators and users share majority of profits

**Solving Real Problems**
- MEV centralization is harmful to crypto ecosystem
- Democratizing access creates more fair markets
- Building public goods for Polkadot

## Contributing

This is open infrastructure for the ecosystem. Contributions welcome:

## Project Status

**Active Development** - Building towards testnet launch

This is a long-term infrastructure project, not a get-rich-quick scheme. We're solving hard problems (cross-chain coordination, fair distribution, flash loan security) and building openly.
